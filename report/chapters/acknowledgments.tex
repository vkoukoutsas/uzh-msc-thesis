I want to thank Christian Killer for his continuous support and guidance, as well as Eder John Scheid for his valuable feedback. Moreover, I want to thank Prof. Dr. Burkhard Stiller for the opportunity to work on this thesis and the Swiss Educhain project. Lastly, I want to thank my family for their endless help and support throughout the duration of my studies.
