	abstract="Diplomas have high importance in society since they serve as official proofs for education. Therefore, it is not surprising that forgeries of such documents have become commonplace. Thus, employers ordinarily have the diplomas manually verified by the issuer. Blockchain creates opportunities to overcome these obstacles, as it has revolutionized the way in which people interact with each other. Based on this, a holistic solution that includes issuance and verification of diplomas can be realized. This paper presents a proposal of a blockchain based system for managing diplomas called UZHBC (University of ZuricH BlockChain).",

	title = {Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System},
	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

The problem is to time-stamp the data, not the medium. We propose computationally practical procedures for digital time-stamping of such documents so that it is infeasible for a user either to back-date or to forward-date his document, even with the collusion of a time-stamping service. Our procedures maintain complete privacy of the documents themselves, and require no record-keeping by the time-stamping service.},

However, the ability to verify the authenticity of certificates does not follow its relevance in the labor market, causing several companies to exploit this inefficiency to falsify information or even to make fake certificates.

This chapter discusses the main proposals toward the handling of academic certificates from a technological point of view, discussing the technical aspects that may influence the relationship between confidentiality and transparency as well as application requirements such as performance and reliability in contrast to the blockchain characteristics.

This document also provides considerations for using {ABAC} to improve information sharing within organizations and between organizations while maintaining control of that information.},

	abstract = {This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats including hostile cyber attacks, natural disasters, structural failures, and human errors. The controls are customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process that manages information security and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and privacy requirements across the federal government and critical infrastructure, derived from legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and/or mission/business needs. The publication also describes how to develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays, tailored for specific types of missions/business functions, technologies, or environments of operation. Finally, the catalog of security controls addresses security from both a functionality perspective (the strength of security functions and mechanisms provided) and an assurance perspective (the measures of confidence in the implemented security capability). Addressing both security functionality and security assurance ensures that information technology products and the information systems built from those products using sound systems and security engineering principles are sufficiently trustworthy.},

These new approaches to identity management ({IdM}) propose to enhance decentralisation, transparency and user control in transactions that involve identity information; but, given the historical challenge to design {IdM}, can these new {DLTbased} schemes deliver on their lofty goals? We introduce the emerging landscape of {DLT}-based {IdM}, and evaluate three representative proposals – {uPort}, {ShoCard} and Sovrin – using the analytic lens of a seminal framework that characterises the nature of successful {IdM} schemes.},
